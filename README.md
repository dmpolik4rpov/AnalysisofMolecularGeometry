The purpose of this project is descrbing geometry of molecule using basic C++ features.
As an input file, it recieves a .dat file with coordinates and number of atoms in the molecule. 
This project shows different aspects of molecular geometry, such as bond lengh, bond angle, out of plane-angle and centre of molecular mass distributed by different axes.
Masses.txt file should be placed in the project folder due to calculating the Molar Mass of molecule
CMake-file is about to arrive soon
